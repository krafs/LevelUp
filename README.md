## FAQ
#### Why do colonists level up and then almost instantly down again?
This is caused by a mechanic in vanilla RimWorld known as *skill decay*. Skills at lvl 10 and higher lose xp. If xp goes low enough, the skill levels down. The rate of skill decay increases with every level - It is slow at lvl 10, and fast at lvl 20.
This can lead to two problems:

- A colonist on level 10 or higher in a skill she almost never uses will lead to that skill almost always ending up at the very top of lvl 9, because skill decay stops as soon as a skill goes below lvl 10. This means that only a tiny bit of xp is needed to level her up to lvl 10 again, which then goes down to 9 again, and so on.

- A colonist with a high level skill she uses almost all the time will likewise lead to that skill jumping up and down between e.g. lvl 19 and 20.

Level Up has a cooldown between actions to make this feel less irritating, but it does not in any way prevent or slow down skill decay.
